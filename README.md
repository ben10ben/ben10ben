Hello, I'm Benedikt Rein, a dedicated student of Business Informatics at Humboldt University, Berlin. My academic journey includes a solid background in social science and politics, supplemented by hands-on software engineering skills acquired at 42 Wolfsburg. My passion lies in the realm of Data Science, where I proficiently utilize tools like Pytorch, Pytorch-Forecasting, Pytorch-Lightning, alongside standard machine learning libraries and Pandas. I am particularly enthusiastic about educating others on the intricacies of big data, machine learning, and the ethical considerations in AI.
